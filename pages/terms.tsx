                                <p>{`You and Sahara Prime agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Sahara Prime arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Terms or to your relationship with Sahara Prime as a user of the Sahara Prime Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of these Terms) will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration. You and Sahara Prime further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim. THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED. The arbitrator must follow these Terms and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees and costs only where allowable under applicable law), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration. This arbitration provision will survive termination of these Terms.`}</p>

In addition, this Arbitration Agreement doesn't stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).`}</p>

Unless both you and Sahara Prime agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person's claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph's limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.`}</p>

The AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.`}</p>
                                <p>{`Any arbitration hearings will be conducted by phone or videoconference to the extent possible, but if the arbitrator determines that a hearing should be conducted in person, the locale for such hearing shall be determined by the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.`}</p>
                                <p>{`If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding and you are required to pay a filing fee, Sahara Prime will reimburse you for that filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case you will be responsible for the filing fee. Sahara Prime will pay any other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator compensation, unless otherwise required by AAA Rules or court order. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.`}</p>

Sahara Prime's address for Notice is: Sahara Prime USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 FakeAddress Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA. The Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (2) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Sahara Prime may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Sahara Prime shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. In the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, and the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Sahara Prime's last written settlement offer, then Sahara Prime will instead pay you either the amount of the award or $1,000, whichever is greater. All documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator's decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.`}</p>

                                <p>{`You and Sahara Prime agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Sahara Prime arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Terms or to your relationship with Sahara Prime as a user of the Sahara Prime Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of these Terms) will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration. You and Sahara Prime further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim. THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED. The arbitrator must follow these Terms and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees and costs only where allowable under applicable law), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration. This arbitration provision will survive termination of these Terms.`}</p>

                                <p>{`You and Sahara Prime both agree that nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to bring an individual action (1) in a U.S. small claims court or (2) in a court of law, in accordance with the jurisdiction and venue described in the Dispute Resolution and Arbitration section above, seeking (a) only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator or (b) public injunctive relief, pending a ruling on the substance of such claim from the arbitrator. In addition, this Arbitration Agreement doesn't stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).`}</p>
                                <p>{`No class Or representative proceedings; class action waiver`}</p>

Unless both you and Sahara Prime agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person's claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph's limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.`}</p>

Any arbitration between you and Sahara Prime will take place under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") then in force (the "AAA Rules"), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. You and Sahara Prime agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above). The AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.`}</p>
                                <p>{`Any arbitration hearings will be conducted by phone or videoconference to the extent possible, but if the arbitrator determines that a hearing should be conducted in person, the locale for such hearing shall be determined by the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.`}</p>
                                <p>{`If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding and you are required to pay a filing fee, Sahara Prime will reimburse you for that filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case you will be responsible for the filing fee. Sahara Prime will pay any other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator compensation, unless otherwise required by AAA Rules or court order. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.`}</p>

Sahara Prime's address for Notice is: Sahara Prime USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 FakeAddress Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA. The Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (2) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Sahara Prime may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Sahara Prime shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. In the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, and the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Sahara Prime's last written settlement offer, then Sahara Prime will instead pay you either the amount of the award or $1,000, whichever is greater. All documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator's decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.`}</p>

                                <p>{`You and Sahara Prime agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Sahara Prime arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Terms or to your relationship with Sahara Prime as a user of the Sahara Prime Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of these Terms) will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration. You and Sahara Prime further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim. THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED. The arbitrator must follow these Terms and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees and costs only where allowable under applicable law), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration. This arbitration provision will survive termination of these Terms.`}</p>

                                <p>{`You and Sahara Prime both agree that nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to bring an individual action (1) in a U.S. small claims court or (2) in a court of law, in accordance with the jurisdiction and venue described in the Dispute Resolution and Arbitration section above, seeking (a) only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator or (b) public injunctive relief, pending a ruling on the substance of such claim from the arbitrator. In addition, this Arbitration Agreement doesn't stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).`}</p>

Unless both you and Sahara Prime agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person's claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph's limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.`}</p>

Any arbitration between you and Sahara Prime will take place under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") then in force (the "AAA Rules"), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. You and Sahara Prime agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above). The AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.`}</p>
                                <p>{`Any arbitration hearings will be conducted by phone or videoconference to the extent possible, but if the arbitrator determines that a hearing should be conducted in person, the locale for such hearing shall be determined by the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.`}</p>
                                <p>{`If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding and you are required to pay a filing fee, Sahara Prime will reimburse you for that filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case you will be responsible for the filing fee. Sahara Prime will pay any other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator compensation, unless otherwise required by AAA Rules or court order. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.`}</p>

Sahara Prime's address for Notice is: Sahara Prime USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 FakeAddress Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA. The Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (2) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Sahara Prime may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Sahara Prime shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. In the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, and the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Sahara Prime's last written settlement offer, then Sahara Prime will instead pay you either the amount of the award or $1,000, whichever is greater. All documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator's decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.`}</p>
